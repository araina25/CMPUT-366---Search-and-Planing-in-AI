# Search and Planning in AI Projects
This repository contains 4 projects that implement various search and planning algorithms in AI.

## Project 1: BFS, Dijkstra's, and IDA
This project implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's, and Iterative Deepening A* (IDA) algorithms. These algorithms are used for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Project 2: A*, IDA*, and Meet in the Middle (MM)
This project implements the A* algorithm, the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, and the Meet in the Middle (MM) algorithm. These algorithms are used for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Project 3: Minimax and Alpha-Beta Search for Connect 4
This project implements the Minimax and Alpha-Beta search algorithms to play the game of Connect 4. These algorithms are used for making decisions in a two-player, turn-based game.

## Project 4: AC3 with Backtracking for Sudoku
This project implements the AC-3 algorithm using backtracking to solve a Sudoku puzzle. The AC-3 algorithm is used for constraint satisfaction, while backtracking is used for finding the solution.

## Requirements
All projects are written in Python 3. You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine in order to run these projects. Additionally, the projects may have additional dependencies, which will be listed in the requirements.txt file for each project.

## Usage
Each project has its own set of instructions for running the code. Please refer to the README file within each project for more information on how to run the code.
